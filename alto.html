        <h2>History of the Alto Saxophone</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The alto saxophone, invented by Adolphe Sax in the 1840s, is pitched in Eâ™­ and is the
                most widely played saxophone today. Its mid-range voice allows it to effectively bridge the
                gap between the higher soprano sax and the lower tenor sax.
            </li>
            <li>Initially, the alto sax found its place in military and concert bands across Europe. Its popularity
                surged in the United States during the early 20th century, particularly with the rise of jazz music.
                Influential musicians like Johnny Hodges and Benny Carter showcased the instrument's smooth and lyrical
                sound, establishing it as a key component of the jazz ensemble.
            </li>
            <li>The alto sax's prominence grew further in the bebop era, particularly through the groundbreaking work of
                Charlie Parker, who used the instrument to redefine jazz improvisation. His rapid, intricate playing showcased
                the alto sax's expressive capabilities, solidifying its status in the jazz canon.
            </li>
            <li>Today, the alto saxophone is a favorite across multiple genres, including jazz, classical, pop, and rock.
                Its versatile sound and wide expressive range make it ideal for both solo performances and ensemble work,
                contributing to its lasting popularity worldwide.
