        <h1>The Tenor Saxophone</h1>

        <h2>History of the Tenor Saxophone</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The tenor saxophone, also invented by Adolphe Sax in the 1840s, is pitched in Bâ™­ and is characterized
                by its rich, warm tone and versatile range. It occupies a middle position within the saxophone family,
                larger than the alto and smaller than the baritone.
            </li>
            <li>Initially, the tenor sax found its way into military bands and orchestras, where its robust sound
                complemented brass instruments. In the early 20th century, the tenor sax became a significant part of
                the jazz movement, with artists like Coleman Hawkins and Lester Young helping to establish its presence
                in the genre.
            </li>
            <li>Today, the tenor saxophone is a staple in various musical styles, including jazz, rock, funk, and classical music.
                Its powerful, expressive sound and dynamic range make it a favorite among musicians, and it remains one of the most
                recognized and celebrated saxophones in contemporary music.
