        <h2>History of the Soprano Saxophone</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>The soprano saxophone was invented by Adolphe Sax in the 1840s, and it has a unique history and a distinctive
                sound that sets it apart. Developed as part of Sax's aim to bridge the tonal gap between woodwind and brass
                instruments, the soprano sax is pitched in B♭ and is one of the higher-voiced saxophones, with a straight,
                slender body.
            </li>
            <li>The soprano sax didn’t gain widespread popularity until the 20th century, due to the difficulty of
                controlling its high-pitched, somewhat piercing tone. In the early jazz era, musicians like Sidney Bechet
                championed the instrument, helping it gain a foothold in jazz with its versatile expressiveness and ability
                to deliver a soulful, penetrating sound. Later, players like John Coltrane further popularized the soprano
                sax in the 1960s, exploring its unique voice in jazz.
            </li>
            <li>Today, the soprano sax is used in various genres, including jazz, classical, and contemporary music. Its clear,
                powerful tone and relatively compact size make it an attractive choice for solo work, and it continues to be
                embraced by players seeking its unique sound and expressive range.
            </li>
